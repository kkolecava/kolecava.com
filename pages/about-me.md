      <h2 class="fw-light">Hey...</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Karol, a freelance Director of Photography, Camera Operator, and licensed drone pilot working across commercial, documentary, music, and sports productions. I split my time between London and Košice (Slovakia), though my work often takes me beyond borders.

        My journey into filmmaking began long before I ever called it a career. As a kid, I “borrowed” my mum’s handycam and cheekily taped over her videos, a rebellious start, but it was my first spark of curiosity with the moving image.

        In my teens, I started editing gameplay videos, blending music and visuals to tell stories and evoke emotion. That instinct to connect image with feeling never left me.
      </p>

        Before diving fully into filmmaking, I worked as a frontend web developer, drawn to design, motion, and user experience. But at 26, I pivoted. Feeling a little late to the game, I made it my mission to catch up. Filming down the beach after work, watching hours of YouTube tutorials during lunch breaks, and absorbing every bit of knowledge I could.
      </p>
      <p>
        That hunger to learn hasn't stopped. Whether it’s shadowing fellow crew on set or experimenting with new gear, I see each project as a chance to evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a background in post-production and over 5 years behind the lens, I bring both technical precision and creative instinct to the table. I care about the details from light and movement to pacing and rhythm and above all, I care about how a story <em>feels</em>.
