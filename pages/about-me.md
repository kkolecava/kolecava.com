      <h2 class="fw-light">Hey..</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a freelance Director of Photography, Camera Operator, and licensed drone pilot working across commercial, documentary, music and sports content. With a background in post-production and over a decade behind the lens, I combine technical precision with creative instinct to craft strong visual narratives.

      <p>
        My kit includes cinema cameras, gimbals, FPV and aerial drones — and I’m always exploring new tools and techniques to elevate the story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently based between the UK and Slovakia, I work worldwide.
